4. Explain Implicit Type Coercion in javascript.
   So js is dynamically typed it means data types are assigned to values at run time 
   so for example if we declare a variable it can hold any data type 
   //correction Implicit type coercion in javascript is automatic conversion of value from one data type to another. 
   //It takes place when the operands of an expression are of different data types.
